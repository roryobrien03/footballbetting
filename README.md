This project aimed to analyse if it could be profitable to use one consistent strategy for betting in Premier League games throughout a season. 

There were 5 main categories of strategies I analysed, each adding up to 380 games and hence a $380 stake
Betting on the home team to win each game 
Betting on the away team to win each game
Betting on a draw in each game
Betting on the underdog (team with lower odds of winning) to win each game
Betting on the favourite (team with higher odds of winning) to win each game

Another category I analysed was if a person was to place a bet on a specific team, for each of their 38 games. This accumulates to a stake of $38
